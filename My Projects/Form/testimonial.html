              The Audi R8 Hycade is a German supercar that has been taken to new
              extremes.

              The widebody kit is visible from a mile away, featuring fenders
              that bulge out like a race car. The front end has been designed
              with a larger set of intakes and a spoiler that looks like it
              doesn't belong on a road.
